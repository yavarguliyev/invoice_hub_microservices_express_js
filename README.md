# üèó Architecture Overview

![Architecture Overview](./image/logical-diagram.png)

---

#### This application follows a microservices architecture where each core business function (Order Management, User Management, etc.) is handled by an independent service. This ensures better scalability, fault isolation, and maintainability.

* Microservices: Each business domain (Orders, Users, Invoices) is isolated into its own service, allowing independent scaling and development.
* Modular Design: Each service follows clear boundaries and can be developed/deployed independently.
* Event-Driven Communication: Services interact asynchronously via Kafka events (e.g., order creation, user updates).
* Asynchronous Processing: Redis is used for caching and message queues, ensuring non-blocking operations.
* Load Balancing: The system scales horizontally using Docker, Kubernetes, and Nginx.

# üß©üîÑ‚öôÔ∏èüåê Interaction Flow in Microservices


![Interaction Flow in DDD and Microservices](./image/interaction-diagram.png)

---

## 1. Domain Layer:

* Houses the core business logic for each microservice (Orders, Users, Invoices).
* Encapsulates operations like changing order statuses, creating users, and generating invoices.

## 2. Service Layer:

* Handles interactions between the domain logic and infrastructure.
* Uses repositories for data persistence and Kafka for event-driven communication.

## 3. Infrastructure Layer:

* Manages PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, and email notifications.
* Redis is leveraged for caching frequently accessed data.

## 4. API Gateway:

* Routes client requests to the appropriate microservice.
* Can aggregate responses from multiple services, reducing client complexity.

## 5. Event-Driven Communication:

* Kafka publishes and consumes events for system-wide updates.
* Example: When an order is approved, a Kafka event triggers the invoice generation process.

# üìèüß≠üí°‚öñÔ∏è Principles

##### This project follows key software design principles to ensure a robust and maintainable codebase:

## 1. SOLID Principles

* Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each class and module has a single responsibility, minimizing changes and complexity.
* Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Classes and modules are open for extension but closed for modification, enabling easier feature additions without breaking existing functionality.
* Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Derived classes can be used in place of their base classes without altering the correctness of the program.
* Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This helps in creating smaller, specialized interfaces.
* Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions, which is achieved through DI.

## 2. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

* The codebase ensures that redundant logic and code are minimized. Reusable components and functions are created for common tasks such as error handling, logging, and validation.

## 3. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

* The application follows a simple and clear architecture, avoiding unnecessary complexity in both the design and implementation. We favor simplicity and readability.

## 4. YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

* Only essential features and functionality are implemented. The project avoids overengineering, focusing on the current requirements.

## 5. Separation of Concerns

* The project ensures that business logic, data access, and presentation are separated. Each module is responsible for a specific concern, promoting modularity and maintainability.

## 6. Composition Over Inheritance

* The project favors composing objects and reusing behavior through composition rather than relying heavily on inheritance.
